# Employee Attrition Prediction

Employee attrition is one of the biggest challenges for organizations, as losing skilled employees is costly in terms of recruiting, training, and productivity. 
Studies show that it can take 6+ months for a company to break even on a new hire, making employee retention strategies crucial.

In this project, I developed a **predictive machine learning model** to identify employees at risk of leaving, enabling organizations to take proactive retention measures.
